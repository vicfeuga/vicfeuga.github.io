        <div class="body-text">Through this internship, I wanted to increase my knowledge and skills 
          in IT development and, above all, get my first professional experience in the IT world.<br /><br />
          The objective of this internship was to set up different tools to help the company LAMY<br />
          - installation of an online inventory platform (GLPI) that allows the company's IT assets to be referenced<br />
          - integration of a document indexing plugin under NextCloud using the "full text search" method (allows to search the content inside the documents)<br />
          - creation of a tool to evaluate the referencing of sites thanks to a simulation of a Google search according to certain keywords

          <div class="body-text">During my internship, I had the opportunity to carry out several assignments. <b>The first</b> was to set 
            up a web-based inventory application on an external server. As the company has a large stock of IT equipment, 
            they needed to have an up-to-date inventory and be able to track it over time.</div>
          <div class="body-text"><b>The second</b> was to set up a search/indexing engine ("Google type") using the 
            "full text search" method (searching the content of the document). The aim was 
            to save the experts time in searching for completed reports (several tens of thousands archived, with many more to come).</div>
          <div class="body-text">Finally, <b>my last task</b> was to create a python program capable of retrieving the rank of a 
            domain name in a Google search according to certain keywords. 
            I had to learn how to use Google's APIs to send the programme's results to a Google Sheets page.</div>

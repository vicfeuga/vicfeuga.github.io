        <div class="body-text">From September 2022 to September 2023, I did an apprenticeship as a member of the
          Innovation Desk team at the Scoring Center in the filial Risk of BPN Paribas Personal Finance located
          in Merignac. Through this year of apprenticeship, I wanted to increase my skills in Data Science,
          discover new techniques and learn more about the working environment of a big company.<br /><br />

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The aim of this apprenticeship was, in a first time, to assist the data scientists of the team by doing a
            research work about categorical encoders. And then, having a more business-oriented mission by
            building a scorecard using logistic regression to identify ‚Äúbad debt‚Äù individuals on credit cards for a
            filial in South Africa.</div>
          <div class="body-text">For <b>the first project</b>, the data preprocessing has a very important influence when it comes to the Machine Learning
            results. Most of the models can‚Äôt handle categorical variables (like RandomForest models which are
            mainly used at the ScoringCenter), except if we change them into numerical values. The model
            performances will rely on how we will encode those data. Depending on the method used, the
            predictions can be highly impacted. And so, the precision might be increased or decreased. Through this research work I learned 
            new ways of encoding techniques (and their impacts) that can be usefull for data scientists. </div>
          <div class="body-text">For <b>the second project</b>, the Scoring Center teams often use Logistical Regression models. The aim of these models is to
            attribute a ‚Äúscore‚Äù based on the input information of a client. It is a grade based on the values of his
            explanatory variables (for example: age, Socio-Professional Category, income). Through this porject I learned how to build and present 
            a scorecard model. Working on a real business project with a real business goal was very nice. I also learned a lot on the methodology of a business
            case and how to document your work. </div>
